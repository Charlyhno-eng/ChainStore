# ChainStore
Private blockchain framework without the notion of cryptocurrency or PoW/PoS

## Purpose

This is my first step in the Go language. The goal is to create a private blockchain model. This project will take me a lot of time because the goal is not only for me to learn Go from scratch but also to create clean, robust code that will be useful to me in the future.
