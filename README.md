# ChainStore
Private blockchain framework without the notion of cryptocurrency or PoW/PoS

## Purpose

This is my first step in the Go language. The goal is to create a private blockchain model. This project will take me a lot of time because the goal is not only for me to learn Go from scratch but also to create clean, robust code that will be useful to me in the future.

## Steps

- **(DONE)** Simple block creation
- Adding a cryptographic signature
- Adding a block chain
- Implementing a block validation system
- Creating a block registry
- Verifying the validity of the entire chain
- Block persistence
- Networking: P2P communication between nodes
- Implementing a consensus
- Adding a CLI to interact with the node
- REST API middleware to add/read blocks
- Adding logs and traceability
---
- Implementation of performance tests
- Implementation of unit & integration testing
